# bayes-drop
Let the Bayes drop! This is a python-based framework for a coin drop sensorimotor task based on the 2004 letter to Nature by Körding and Wolpert. The task investigates whether the brain generates internal probabilistic models to estimate the position of a visual target.

This is the experimental setup explained:

Result of an individual trial. We measure the performance by the deviation of the coin's' lateral position from the one of the cursor's.
